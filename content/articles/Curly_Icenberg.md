Summary: Winning my First Auction

I revamped this page with the original intention of refreshing my Digital Ocean Droplet for a new project
related to the Housing Works NYC non-profit. They support AIDs and homelessness causes in the city, and one
of their funding sources is via an auction. The auction often has incredible items, namely art, but unfortunately there's 
no means of staying updated about the items unless you visit the page everyday. Alas, I wrote a scrapper
that emails me all the items in the next auction. It's not a bidding bot, nor do I ever tend to create one,
but it's fun to see what items are available.

So 8 months later, I finally won my first auction. For those who know, you know why it's on brand. I've also named it
Curly Icenberg who is a fictional head of lettuce that I created to for a deck to explain the Blend Ratio Solver I worked on at Bowery.
It's an impressive work of art, much larger and vibrant than the images led me to believe. Also, there's a specific
dopamine hit when the auction clock winds down, and you're alerted as the winner.
