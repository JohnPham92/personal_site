Summary: Winning my First Auction

I updated my DigitalOcean droplet and consequently, this website with intention of working on a new project related to
the Housing Works NYC non-profit. The organization supports the fight against AIDs and homelessness.
And one of their funding sources is via an auction. The auction often has incredible items, including unique artwork,
but unfortunately, there's
no means of staying updated about the items unless you visit the page every day. Consequently, I wrote a scraper
that emails me all the items available in the next auction. It's not a bidding bot, just an alert system. But it's fun
to see what random assortment of items is available.
And our empty white apartment walls could use some personality.

So, 8 months later, I've finally bid in my first auction and actually won! It is a print signed and dated from 1968 by
the artist John Ulbricht. For those who know, the artwork is painfully on brand. I've named it
Curly Icenberg, who is a fictional head of lettuce that I created in a deck to explain the Blend Ratio Solver project I
worked on at Bowery.
It's an impressive work of art, much larger and vibrant than the images led me to believe. And the little dopamine hit
of winning an auction was icing on the cake.
