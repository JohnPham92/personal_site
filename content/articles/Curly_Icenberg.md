Summary: Winning my First Auction

I originally revamped my DigitalOcean droplet and this website intending to work on a new project related to the Housing Works NYC non-profit. The organization supports the fight AIDs and homelessness. One
of their funding sources is via an auction. The auction often has incredible items, namely art, but unfortunately there's 
no means of staying updated about the items unless you visit the page every day. Alas, I wrote a scrapper
that emails me all the items available in the next auction. It's not a bidding bot, merely an alert system. But it's fun to see what items are available.
And our empty white apartment walls could use some personality. 

So 8 months later, I've finally won my first auction. For those who know, the art work is painfully on brand. I've also named it
Curly Icenberg who is a fictional head of lettuce that I created to for a deck to explain the Blend Ratio Solver project I worked on at Bowery.
It's an impressive work of art, much larger and vibrant than the images led me to believe. And I'd be lying if I said there was not a little dopamine hit
from winning.
