Summary: The journey continues

The journey to qualifying for Boston continues into 2024.

A better late than never recap.

In August 2023, I completed the Tunnel Vision Marathon in Snoqualmie, WA. We stayed out in Washington for an extra week after a wedding,
and the course was rumored to be a BQ dream: 2000 ft of entirely downhill and cool summer running temperatures. The downhill part
was accurate, but there had been a heat advisory issued with temperatures in the high 70s and 80% rH by finish time.
I finished in 2:58:35 and absolutely beaming with joy going under sub-3 in my first marathon. Realistically, I had only
processed this after crushing salt tablets with a cold towel under the medical tent.

The course is incredibly unique with views of the Snoqualmie mountains (ski resort in the winter), an old 2 mile railroad tunnel illuminated
by runners' headlamps, and the sound of packed gravel crunching beneath your feet. It is a small race (510 marathon finishers)
with only a handful of fans and park goers cheering you on. However, there is something comforting and simple about
dumping your race bag on a tarp and then lining up for 26.2 miles without going through security, loading areas, or
corrals of gates. What a contrast to even the smallest NYRR races in NYC. It also attracts an overwhelmingly friendly
group of runners, volunteers, and fans! I couldn't recommend it enough especially if you're looking for something totally
different from a large road race. Did I mention there is a large dunk tank and cake at the end of the race?

Many things learned as a first time marathoner. The old adage -- the race starts at mile 20. I don't think I've physically willed myself to do something
harder than trudge the final 6 miles of the race especially after 24 mile never seemed to end (the marker went MIA). My hamstrings were locking up, and I was
starting to do my signature dead runner lean to one side. I went out too hot in the first half (1:27 split) and paid for it in the second half as the heat, dehydration, and fatigue caught up.
The last 4 miles were particularly painful and consisted of internal expletives. I will not forget the post-race shower and nap. Glorious! 

Unfortunately, the Boston Marathon had record all-time applicants for its 2024 race. I fell victim to the cutoff.
I actually wasn't even close (2:54:30ish) which made me feel better honestly. Seconds off would've killed me.
So revenge race it is spring 2024.
