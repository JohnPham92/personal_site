Summary: Introductory Post

In hopes of finding art to cover my barren apartment walls, I created a web crawler for an auction site that sends an
email alert right before final bidding. Eager to have a weekend project, I was almost too quick to fork over &#128176;
to AWS, then remembered I had a Digital Ocean droplet serving the 5 yearly hits to my blog.

That original blog was created nearly 8 years ago when I was still learning my way around programming. I was eager to
learn which ended up being a Django that I painstakingly copy and pasted code from a YouTube video. And I wrote custom
HTML/CSS as proof of my expertise from myspace pages of yestyear. Now <s> with less to prove </s> with an appreciation
for simplicity, I'm starting with a static site. I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to start anew with content.
Hoping to win some art to have something to talk about.

Cheers to kicking off this new version!
