Summary: Introductory Post

In hopes of finding art to cover my barren apartment walls, I created a web crawler for an auction site that sends an
email alert right before final bidding. Eager to have a weekend project, I was almost too quick to fork over &#128176;
to AWS, but then remembered I had a Digital Ocean droplet serving the 5 annual visits to my blog.

That original blog was made 8 years ago when I was still learning how to program. I ended up with a bloated Django site
by mostly copy and pasting code from YouTube. And I wrote custom HTML/CSS as proof of myspace skills. Now <s> with less
to prove </s> with an appreciation for simplicity, I'm starting with a static site. I also wanted to take this
opportunity to start the new content. Hoping to win some art to have something to talk about.

Cheers to kicking off this new edition!
