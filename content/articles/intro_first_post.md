Summary: Introductory Post

For a weekend project, I wrote a script that scrapes data from an auction site and sends an email alert prior to auction
end. I was quick to reach for a new EC2 instance but remembered I had a Digital Ocean droplet that hosts my blog. The
original blog was created nearly 8 years ago when I was still writing everything as nested for loops. My decision to use
Django at the time was beginner's ambitions, and I've since simplified my personal site into a static web page hosted on
the same droplet. I also wanted to use this as an opportunity to start anew as well and have deleted my older posts.

Cheers to kicking off this new version!
