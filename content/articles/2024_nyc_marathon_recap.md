Summary: Best Party in the City

The NYC Marathon was the best consolation for not getting into Boston. I took a couple of weeks off
after the race in August to give my legs and my brain a second to recover. I decided that breaking 3 hours again was the goal, but
I also wanted to a chance to run without so much pressure in my hometown race. The spring is when I'll take on the ace race.
An honest shift on race day was all I could ask for especially with friends and family coming to cheer!

I ended up running 3:01:03.

This was short of the goal, but I couldn't have asked for a more exhilrating race. I was overcome with waves of fatigue, inspiration, and emotion.
I executed  my race plan as well as I had hoped. The course is no joke, particularly the last 3 miles up 5th Ave and into Central Park.
It was a party the entire time, and it's so inspiring to be out there with thousands of others. The fans make the New York Marathon.
I'll never pass up the opportunity to run this race.
